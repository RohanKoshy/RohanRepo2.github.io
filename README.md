**Test Plan**

Since me, Justin, and Kian are the only members in our 8 person group who will take the AP test this May, our test plan will primarily consist of reviewing material directly from the AP college board FRQs and MCQs, as well as rewatching the tutorial videos. We will start going through each unit week by the week together, meeting to talk about any questions or doubts we have, in addition to doing our pbl work.


**Notes for Week 1 Tech Talk**
* Linked Lists are dynamic, compared to arrays or Hashmaps. 
* Question: Why are Linked Lists used and what advantage do they have compared to other forms of Data Structures?
* Question: How do you iterate through a for loop? Does it have an index?
* A Queue is another data structure related to linked lists designed to have values inputted at the end of the structure, and deleted at the beginning of the structure.
* Queues need their beginning(head node), ending(tail node), and current(the current node) tracked for all its functions.
Question: How are Linkedlists crucial for a Queue?
Questions: What is Push entry and pop extraction?
